# The promotion Patter

## Work in progress...


Promotion pattern (is my pattern hhh) dictate that a modules whatever it could be (component, function, type, hook, api service, u name it ), generally it should start locally with the dedicated module for it (business module, page, ...)

Once you hit the point where u spot a reusable module, here the reusability could be two times, three times ... depends again on the complexity of the module (sometimes some complexe logic, once u start to use it a second time u have to refactor it and extract it to a reusable module)

Once you spot that reusability, u promote the module to it specific directory (for example: a component to common)
